# To do

[x] Calculate Lipschitz constant
[x] Use Lipschitz constant to set stepsize
[x] Find smallest lambda with 0
[x] Empirical Bayes to estimated random effects
[x] Implement solution path starting at lambda max
[x] Implement BIC for solution pas
  - BIC should be -2llk +  vlog(nh)/nh (eq. -2llk <- rss since the other term is contsant, but there be some scaling issue?)
[ ] Adaptively choose the kernel scale
  - BIC might not be the best approach since log(nh) can get negative
  - KLasso paper requires h~n^-1/5
  - look at what the properties of log(nh)/(nh) are required? might need to restrict ot the monotonically decreasing part
  - convex for h > e^(3/2) / n
  - looks like choosing it without penalty should be very good
[ ] Experiemnt with estimation of Sigma
[ ] Connection to Spline, GP?
